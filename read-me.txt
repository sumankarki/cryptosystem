Computer Security - CS 527
Project 2: CryptoSystem
Suman Karki, (011529935), suman.karki@wsu.edu

1. For simplicity, I assumed all files will be in same directory. I also haven't asked user for the location of keys file, plain text file and cipher text file. So, all the files if created, will be in the same directory as source codes.

2. Following files are present in the zip file:
	i.  Source Code ( cryptosystem.java and Helper.java)
	ii. Keys file ( prikey.txt and pubkey.txt )
	iii.Plain text file ( ptext.txt )
	iv. Cipher text file ( ctext.txt )
	v.  Decryptedt text file ( dtext.txt )
	
3. To build the source code, open the terminal and navigate to the directory of source code and run following command:
	$ javac *.java
	
4. To run the program, run following command
	$ java cryptosystem
	
5. Three options are available:

	i.  Keys generation ( Option 1 )
		It generates the public key and private key on its own and saves it to pubkey.txt and prikey.txt . The project description asks for user to enter random value, but I didn't see its any use in the given algorithm (slide), so I didn;t ask for user's input.
		
	
	ii. Encryption ( Option 2 )
		It reads plain text file (ptext.txt) and encrypts the text and stores it in cipher text file (ctext.txt). To make it simple, without any user's input for filename and file location, I saved the file in current directory i.e., source code directory.
		
	iii. Decryption ( Option 3 )
		It reads cipher text file (ctext.txt) and decrypts the text and stores it in decrypted text file (dtext.txt). Again, to make it simple, without any user's input for filename and file location, I saved the file in current directory i.e., source code directory.
		
	iv. To exit the program, type 'exit' and enter.
